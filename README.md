# Number-Sort
Develop a program that arranges the series of
decimal numbers shown in
ascending order from smallest to
largest, then prints them out.

When the numbers are printed, put
a carriage return/line feed between
each, for neatness. Note 1: You will
not need any counters, as the data
provided has a final zero value, so
that all you have to do is test for 0
and then quit. Note that the 0 is
NOT to be printed out—it is not a
value to be compared but merely an
“edge” to tell you that the list is
over.
- Note 2: This must be a recursive
program.
